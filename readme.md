Skitter
=======

A simple webapp for creating skit titles to video.

This project was specifically for AMV Hell; I got tired of running back to the site anytime I wanted to see what this anime or that sound clip was.

It must be run from a webserver, preferably a light one.  Once that's done, modify config.js appropriately and open index.html in your browser.  Instructions are right there.

Why ASS?
--------

Advanced Substation Alpha subtitles enable formatting, positioning and coloring, all of which I wanted for that "music video titling" effect.

Fact is, though, since you have control over the templates, you have control over what type of subtitle file you create.  You'll have to futz with the code to change the extension, and possibly skitter.formatStamp for the french comman in srt files if that's your game - but whatever.  It's easy enough.

So... you've done this?

Yes.  See the [output here](https://github.com/Fordi/amv-skit-titles).
